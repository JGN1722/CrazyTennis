# CrazyTennis
![In-game screenshot](CrazyTennis.png)
This game was created over 4 days for a programming lab with [TUMO Paris](https://paris.tumo.fr/). It was my first successful [raycasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_casting) project. It's a simple tennis game in which you move with the arrow keys, and hit the ball with the space bar.  
You can enjoy it [here](https://editor.p5js.org/come.d/sketches/q0zRkDT85).
